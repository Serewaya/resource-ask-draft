title: "How Do We Protect User Information?"

---

At Resource ASK our user’s privacy is of utmost value to us. This is how we use the information of our users in order to ensure there are no data breaches where our user’s may be compromised.


We ensure that user information that is entered through our search commands is not saved but directly sent to the database to retrieve user results. This is an effective way to protect information as the jurisdictions* in which the Resource ASK Bot’s actions occur are secure and when information is sent to the database and back it is encrypted.
##### *specific jurisdictions include Google Cloud Hosting and Mongo DB

## Why We Use Wide Classifications
The two pieces of personal information that the Resource ASK Bot requires are **Area and Gender**. In order to ensure that we don’t have very specific user information these clauses can be entered as only 1 of 3 options. In addition we don’t focus in on location but look at a wide area scope of the country that you are located in.

 All that was stated above provide for information to be indistinct if a data breach occurs to Google which is where the Resource ASK Bot’s activities occur. Which allow for data the data not to hold much relevance to you as an individual which would put you at risk.  
 
 **We Promise:**
 - No ad's
 - No tracking
 - No social features
 - Always private
