Resource ASK has 4 main factors that contribute to resource categorization **Category, Expiration, Area, and Gender.** An example of a resource in our database is similar to the following:
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

Curabitur pretium tincidunt lacus. Nulla gravida orci a odio. Nullam varius, turpis et commodo pharetra, est eros bibendum elit, nec luctus magna felis sollicitudin mauris. Integer in mauris eu nibh euismod gravida. Duis ac tellus et risus vulputate vehicula. Donec lobortis risus a elit.

| *Url or File Link*       | Category         | Expiration      | Gender          |
|--------------------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| https://example.com      | Loans            | 05-30-2022      | None            |

### Category

The category is the main classification of the resource, it shows what the resource is used for. Access this link for a comprehensive list of all the available categories.

The Resource ASK team is able to find the category from sifting through the resource url, this aspect is also the most important in terms of resource categorization.

### Expiration

The expiration date is the time that applications are due or date that the opportunity is no longer being offered. The Resource ASK team gets this date directly from accessing the resource itself.

The expiration date is also the key which shows when the resource gets put into the “recycling bin” otherwise known as when it gets removed from the main database.

### Area

The area is the specific scope which the resource is being offered, there are three main area classifications _Canada, United States, and Other._

### Gender

Sometimes resources are offered only for individuals of a specific gender, so during those occurrences the gender classification is changed to either _Female, Male or Other._

**These clauses are all available to be searched for through the Resource ASK Bot’s output command. If you want to opt out of searching for specific clauses leave the space as black and the search will return with all listings in that field.**
