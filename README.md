## The Challenge

A great percentage of Black entrepreneurs do not have access to support or advice to help them run their businesses. Access to funding, financing, capital and sales is a great challenge for Black entrepreneurs with 75% of them saying that if they need $10,000 to support their business it would be difficult for them to do so.
